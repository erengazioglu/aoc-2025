# Advent of Code 2025

Solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) puzzles in Python.

## How to use

After making sure you downloaded the inputs with the correct names (01-full, 01-sample, 02-full...), just run the entire directory as a Python program:

```
python3 aoc-2025
```

Extra command line options are available, run the program with the `-h` flag for more information.

## To do

- The program should be able to run individual days (update `__main__.py`)
- Write a more descriptive help page (`python3 aoc-2025 -h`)
- Write explanations for each day?


<!-- 
## Structure

Each day's puzzle _solution_ is in its own directory:
```
aoc_utils.py               # Shared utility functions
template.py                # Template for new days
day01/
  __init.py__              # Python solution
  (other necessary files)
day02/
  __init.py__
  ...
...
```
The puzzle inputs are stored in an inputs/ folder, which is hidden from git (in .gitignore).

## Getting Started

### For a new day:

1. Create the day directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir dayXX
   ```

2. Copy the template:
   ```bash
   cp template.py dayXX/solution.py
   ```

3. Create the input file:
   ```bash
   touch dayXX/input.txt
   ```

4. Paste your puzzle input into `dayXX/input.txt`

5. Implement your solution in `dayXX/solution.py`

6. Run your solution:
   ```bash
   cd dayXX
   python solution.py
   ```

## Example

Day 1 is already set up as an example:
```bash
cd day01
python solution.py
```

## Tips

- Each day has two parts - implement them in `part1()` and `part2()` functions
- The `read_input()` function is imported from `aoc_utils.py` and reads your puzzle input from `input.txt`
- Keep it simple - just plain Python, no fancy frameworks needed! -->
